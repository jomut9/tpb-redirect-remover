# tpb-redirect-remover
The Pirate Bay links redirect remover
## Why
To bypass redirect of link in The Pirate Bay and visit directly. For example:

`https://thepiratebay3.org/url=http://abc.com` will be changed to `http://abc.com`.
## How
1. Have a userscript manager installed for your browser:
   * [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) for Mozilla Firefox
   * [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for almost every browser
   * [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) for almost every browser
2. Download the tpb-redirect-remover.user.js here and install it with your userscript manager.
3. Have fun!
